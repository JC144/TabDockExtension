This application brings a dock to gather tabs by domain and display them like a Mac Os dock.

The idea was to organize better tabs in a web browser to provider a better User Experience.

The dock will behave in a similar manner than a desktop one:
* Hover will display all opened tabs for a domain
* A click on the cross will close each
* A middle button click will open a new tab and focus on it
* A left click will only open a tab

You can drag n drop items in the dock and tabs
